# CIS 4250 - Gryph Eats Mobile Food Delivery App

Gryph Eats is a mobile Food delivery APP designed for iOS13 for University of Guelhp Restaurants. This app was designed and developed by Domenic Bianchi, Matthew Bebis, Scott Riva and Shuaib Solker as a part of the CIS 4250 Software Design V Course.

The app utilizes Swift for the development of the iOS front end app, with a backend utilizing SQL as well as Apollo GraphQL. The App is designed to interface via iPhone for the consumer, and via iPad for the restaurant/kitchen staff, with a dedicated UI in place for both that will update in real time as orders are placed and updated.

On the customer side of the app, customers can select their desired restaurant, and add any number of products from that restaurant to that cart. In addition, for applicable items the user can customize toppings and sides for a particular menu item. The menus and restaurants are completely dynamic and can be customized on the backend.

The iPhone app on the customer side will display the status of their order, to indicate how far along in the preparation process it is, as well as the estimated time to completion, to allow the user to prepare to pickup their food. On the restaurant side of the app, you can see orders in real time, as well as the full details of the user's order as well as input status updates to notify the user, as well as track orders that need to be completed.
