# CIS 4250 - Gryph Eats Mobile Food Delivery App

Gryph Eats is a mobile Food delivery APP designed for iOS13 for University of Guelhp Restaurants. This app was designed and developed by Domenic Bianchi, Matthew Bebis, Scott Riva and Shuaib Solker as a part of the CIS 4250 Software Design V Course.

The app utilizes Swift for the development of the iOS front end app, with a backend utilizing SQL as well as Apollo GraphQL. The App is designed to interface via iPhone for the consumer, and via iPad for the restaurant/kitchen staff, with a dedicated UI in place for both that will update in real time as orders are placed and updated.
